 Here is an example of how you could create a discord bot using the MTM0NDAyOTQ4NDAyNTc3NDE0MA.GXuS\_R.rapKVBX-yOqIVAXFU-utFvl1PgHMWRp70PiucQ model:
```
import discord
from transformers import pipeline

# Initialize the language model
model = pipeline("text-generation", model="MTM0NDAyOTQ4NDAyNTc3NDE0MA.GXuS_R.rapKVBX-yOqIVAXFU-utFvl1PgHMWRp70PiucQ")

# Initialize the discord client
intents = discord.Intents.default()
client = discord.Client(intents=intents)

@client.event
async def on_ready():
    print("Logged in as {0.user}".format(client))

@client.event
async def on_message(message):
    if message.author == client.user:
        return
    
    # Get the response from the model
    response = model(message.content)
    
    # Respond with the generated text
    await message.channel.send(response[0])

client.run("YOUR_DISCORD_TOKEN")
```
This code will create a discord bot that uses the MTM0NDAyOTQ4NDAyNTc3NDE0MA.GXuS\_R.rapKVBX-yOqIVAXFU-utFvl1PgHMWRp70PiucQ model to generate responses to messages in discord servers.

Please note that the code above is only an example and may need to be modified or expanded upon depending on your specific needs and requirements.
